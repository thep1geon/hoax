 *
 * This collection of data structures is meant to emulate typical generic data
 * structures you might find in a more featured language like Rust or C++. Most
 * of these data structures are just that, named data. But some (like the linked
 * list and dynamic array) do have associated "methods". One goal of this collection
 * is to keep the number of "methods" to a minimum. This library is supposed to
 * give you the data structures, it is up to you to put them to work. Dynamic
 * arrays and linked lists are different because they don't have a whole lot of
 * functionality without certain methods. A few handy, type agnostic macros have
 * also been provided, like the for-each macro for both the linked list and
 * dynamic array, as well as "constructors" for results and optionals.
 *
 * Another purpose of this library is just reduce boilerplate in my own code.
 * These are some of the most commonly used data structures, so I decided to
 * take the time and make them generic (but type-safe). Type safety is something
 * I really strive for in this implementation. If a data structure's "method"
 * needs a specificed type, I make the "method" an actual function to ensure
 * the type is checked by the compiler. I am aware of the _Generic macro feature
 * in C11, but I wanted to keep this compatible with C99.
 *
 * Because of the nature of C, a lot of this has been hacked together and
 * is probably not suitable for production code. Since we dealing with types
 * at the lexical level, we cannot really tell if the user passed in a type or
 * just gibberish -- this is caught by the compiler. But, this means if you use
 * a naming convention that prepends the struct keyword to your defined structs,
 * the majority of this code will not work since you cannot have spaces in C 
 * identifiers; this matters because we append the passed type onto the name
 * of the data structure; so, if a user passed in `struct point` into dynarray()
 * or something similar, it would not even compile. To get around this we have
 * to employ a little hack in the form of a suffix of the declaration of the
 * generic data structure (the _S prefix for struct). This works because, in the
 * case the user wants to use a struct type, we can just use the tag (or name) of
 * the struct and have the macro fill in the struct keyword for us when its needed.
 *
 * This is a little hacky, but the alternative would be forcing the user to typedef
 * all of their types which I do not fancy (mainly because I didn't want to have
 * to do that). While this addresses the problem of structs, it does not address
 * the problem of enums, unions, and pointers of all kinds.
 *
 * Let's start with enums and unions -- this is a tricky one for sure. Enumerations
 * are just named integer constants, so you don't really need to typedef these unless
 * that's your coding style. Unions are kind of similar, if you're going to be
 * using a union a data structure like this, you should be making it a tagged
 * union at the least; this will also let you use the _S declarations and it works
 * without a hitch.
 *
 * Now to talk about the elephant in the room: pointers of all kinds. With the
 * current implementation, you cannot just pass a pointer in the DECL macro, for
 * the same reason you couldn't use the struct keyword. This presents us with two
 * fixes, one, we add another prefix which denotes a pointer type. This will work with
 * pointers to types just fine, but will require the addition of many more macros
 * for declarations. The second option, and more feasible option, just require
 * a typedef for pointers only. This will let pointers work with the default
 * declaration macro for any data structure; as a bonus function pointers and
 * arrays would also work with this strategy. While I don't want to force typedefs
 * on every type the user wants to use with this little collection of data
 * structures, it is compromisable to force it for pointer types. This actually
 * has a few reasons of its own. One, it forces the user to acknowlege that they
 * are using pointer types in the data structure which is vital if they need to
 * free anything themselves since the free functions associated with the data
 * structures only free what they allocated. This means if you passed heap allocated
 * pointers into a dynamic array, you are responsible for freeing those heap
 * allocated objects, not the dynamic array. By forcing the user to typedef their
 * pointers, they are reminded to free them. Secondly, it makes the code easier
 * to write. I don't have to add a whole bunch of prefixes denoting pointer types
 * which makes my job easier, and the library easier to use - a win win for both
 * of us.
 *
 * Obviously, this library could be improved in many ways, but I think I have done
 * a decent job here.
 *
 * I am aware I am missing some other commonly used data
 * structures like hashmaps and trees of all sorts. But those are more complicated
 * and would require much more attention to detail. For example, a hashmap
 * not only requires two types, the key and value types, but a hash function
 * for the key and an equals function for the key. This is more cumbersome than
 * it needs to be for what I am going for, so I will be leaving it out for the
 * time being. If push comes to shove, I can implement a generic HashMap along
 * with other data structures that require additional functions to work. I will
 * also not be implementing stacks, queues, deques, doubly linked lists, or any
 * other data structure that can be emulated with the data structures currently
 * provided. This is for two reasons, firstly, it is just more work on me just
 * to rename existing data structures. And secondly, you can just use a linked
 * list or dynamic array for most of your use cases. In the event you cannot use
 * one of those two, you probably just need to roll your own anyway.
 *
 * With just a little bit of reading, I found another strategy for allowing any
 * type, regardless of the characters in the type (`struct`, pointers, etc.) that
 * relies on the user naming each data structure they declare instead of the macro
 * doing it for you. This has its own pros and cons. For pros, the types can be
 * anything, typedef'd or not. This allows for flexibility of the types and it keeps
 * the names of the declaration macros shorter and easier to read. But all great
 * things have their drawbacks. For starters, letting users define their own names
 * for types could become a bit of a foot-gun. By forcing the user onto a generated
 * name, it ensures there is consistency between types, keeping the code easier
 * to read and write. Another drawback would be added complexity the user wants
 * to declare a data structure instead of only when its actually necessary. An
 * additional parameter to each declaration macro would also make the code harder
 * to read. All in all, this could be a good idea, but for now, I want to stick
 * with what I have now. If I have any strong reasons to update it, I can do so
 * later.
